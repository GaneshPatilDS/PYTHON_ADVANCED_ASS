    "Sure, I'd be happy to explain those Python questions in point format with easy-to-understand language:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing:**\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Catch and manage errors that may occur during program execution.\n",
    "- **File Operations:** Handle situations where files can't be opened, read, or written properly.\n",
    "- **Input Validation:** Check user inputs for correctness, avoiding crashes due to invalid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?**\n",
    "- **Crash:** If an unhandled exception occurs, the program abruptly stops and displays an error message, making it hard to continue executing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?**\n",
    "- **Try-Except Block:** Surround potentially error-prone code with a `try` block; if an exception occurs, the `except` block can handle it gracefully.\n",
    "- **Multiple Except Blocks:** Different `except` blocks can handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "- **Finally Block:** The `finally` block can be used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script:**\n",
    "- **Raise Statement:** You can manually raise an exception using the `raise` statement. For instance, `raise ValueError(\"Invalid value\")` raises a `ValueError` exception.\n",
    "- **Built-in Exceptions:** Many built-in exceptions are raised automatically by Python, like `ZeroDivisionError` when dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists:**\n",
    "- **Finally Block:** The `finally` block, placed after a `try` and/or `except` block, contains code that will run regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "- **Atexit Module:** You can use the `atexit` module to register functions that should be executed when the program terminates, even if no exceptions were raised."
